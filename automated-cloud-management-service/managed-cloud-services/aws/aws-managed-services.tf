    # Unfortunately, AWS Managed Services is not a specific service that can be directly managed with Terraform resources. It's a broader concept encompassing managed services offerings from AWS. 
# You'll need to use Terraform resources specific to the individual managed services you're using, such as AWS EKS for Kubernetes, Amazon RDS for databases, or Amazon S3 for object storage. 
# Here's an example of managing an AWS EKS cluster using Terraform:

# Configure the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Replace with your desired region
}

# Create an AWS EKS cluster
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
  name     = "my-eks-cluster"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.eks_cluster_role.arn
  # Optional settings
  version = "1.21"
  # ...
}

# Create an IAM role for the EKS cluster
resource "aws_iam_role" "eks_cluster_role" {
  name = "eks-cluster-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  })
}

# Attach necessary IAM policies to the role
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "eks_cluster_policy" {
  role = aws_iam_role.eks_cluster_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSClusterPolicy"
}

# Create an EKS node group
resource "aws_eks_node_group" "main" {
  cluster_name = aws_eks_cluster.main.name
  # ...
}

# ... other resources to manage your EKS cluster, such as Kubernetes deployments, services, etc.
